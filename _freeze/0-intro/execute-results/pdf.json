We assume you are broadly comfortable with R code, the RStudio environment and the tidyverse.\n  * This is not a statistics course. We assume you are familiar with concepts such as the mean, standard deviation, quantiles, regression, normal distribution, likelihood, etc.\n  * This is not a theory course. We are not going to derive anything. We will teach you time series and forecasting tools, when to use them, and how to use them most effectively.\n\n## Key reference\n\n\\large\n\n\\begin{block}{}\\bf\n\\hangafter=1\\hangindent=.3cm\n {Hyndman, R.~J. \\& Athanasopoulos, G.

Guru: I wrote the book, done it for decades, now I do the conference circuit.\n  2. Expert: It has been my full time job for more than a decade.\n  3. Skilled: I have been doing it for years.\n  1. Comfortable: I understand it and have done it.\n  1. Learner: I am still learning.\n  1. Beginner: I have heard of it and would like to learn more.\n  1. Unknown: What is forecasting? Is that what the weather people do?\n\n## Poll: How proficient are you in using R?\n\n\\fontsize{14}{15}\\sf\n\n  1. Guru: The R core team come to me for advice.\n  1. Expert: I have written several packages on CRAN.\n  1. Skilled: I use it regularly and it is an important part of my job.\n  1. Comfortable: I use it often and am comfortable with the tool.\n  1. User: I use it sometimes, but I am often searching around for the right function.\n  1. Learner: I have used it a few times.\n  1. Beginner: I've managed to download and install it.\n  1. Unknown: Why are you speaking like a pirate?\n\n## Install required packages\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"tidyverse\",\n  \"fpp3\",\n  \"GGally\"\n))\n```\n\n## Approximate outline\n\\vspace*{-0.1cm}\\centering\\fontsize{12}{12}\\sf\n\\begin{tabular}{rp{6.6cm}l}\n  \\bf Day & \\bf Topic                   & \\bf Chapter \\\\\n  \\midrule\n  1       & 1.
